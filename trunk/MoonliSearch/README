				MoonliSearch V1.0.0
  In this version, I have to say i just finish the back-end, i mean MoonliSearch could do the seach without the GUI, so it's ugly. But I will complete this module, when i make the decision whether MoonliSearch is a client or WebService.


How to Start the MoonliSearch:
1.Config the MoonliSearch:

At first, i Must declare the $HOME  means where you put the MoonliSearch

	(1)cd() to the MoonliSearch Home Direction, and find the 'moonliSearch.conf':
	
	BasePath: Where the Crawler/WebRobot will download the Page 
	FILENAME: Please put it as "./Posting/lib/webRankInfo"
		(In some point, the way i set the Var is not fit)
	
	(2)run the 'LoadConfig.py':
		python LoadConfig.py

2.Let the WebRobot Works:
	1)cd() to ./WebRobot
		cd ./WebRobot
	2)Run the WebRobot
		python WebRobot
	3)Right Now, the crawler is started! You just need to input you URL


3.Posting EveryKeyWord:
	1)Build up your own KeyWord Lib($HOME/Posting/lib/Keyword.lib):
		
	2)Run the Posting_Main($HOME/Posting/)
		python Posting_Main.py
